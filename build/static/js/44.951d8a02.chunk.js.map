Older people, and those with\r\n                  underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease,\r\n                  diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more\r\n                  likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and\r\n                  slow down transmission is to be well informed about the\r\n                  COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.\r\n                  Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your\r\n                  hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not\r\n                  touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily\r\n                  through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an\r\n                  infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you\r\n                  also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing\r\n                  into a flexed elbow).\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p className=\"lead\">\r\n                  <CButton color=\"primary\" size=\"lg\">\r\n                    Learn More\r\n                  </CButton>\r\n                </p>\r\n              </CJumbotron>\r\n            </CCardBody>\r\n          </CCard>\r\n        </CCol>\r\n        <CCol>\r\n          <CCard>\r\n            <CCardBody>\r\n              <CJumbotron fluid>\r\n                <CContainer fluid>\r\n                  <h6 className=\"display-4\">\r\n                    Self-isolation and treating symptoms of coronavirus\r\n                    (COVID-19)\r\n                  </h6>\r\n                  <p className=\"lead\">\r\n                    Self-isolate immediately if: you have any symptoms of\r\n                    COVID-19 (a high temperature, a new, continuous cough or a\r\n                    loss or change to your sense of smell or taste) you've\r\n                    tested positive for COVID-19 – this means you have the virus\r\n                    someone you live with has symptoms or tested positive.
