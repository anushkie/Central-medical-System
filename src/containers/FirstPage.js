  The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped our health care system. Health care workers have, for the last year and a half, put time and effort into coping with the rising numbers of COVID-19 patients. Many have also dealt with a shortage of personal protective equipment and had to quickly adjust to offering care virtually. The next challenge is navigating the limit to the services our health care system will be able to offer â€” especially as provinces and territories work through the backlog of surgeries and screenings that were postponed because of the pandemic and deal with the increased need for mental health services and chronic disease care.

In rare cases, adults who have recovered from COVID-19 may develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and clinicians should consider this possibility in adults with specific symptoms, as physicians describe in a case published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).

A 60-year-old man, who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks before, visited hospital for a range of symptoms, including prolonged shortness of breath, high fever, swelling and severe fatigue. Testing found an enlarged heart and lung swelling as well as other issues.`;
